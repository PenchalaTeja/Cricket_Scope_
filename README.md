## Cricket Data Analysis: 

A project leveraging advanced data analytics to unearth key insights from cricket matches, aiming to enhance player selection, strategy formulation, and overall game experience. This involves database design, data wrangling, and interactive dashboard creation in Power BI for strategic decision-making.

## Objective and Overview: 

Our team at a leading Data Analytical firm is embarking on a project to analyze cricket match data provided by a prestigious client. Our goal is to dive deep into the data to discover patterns, trends, and insights that will give our clients a competitive edge. This includes evaluating player performances, team strategies, match outcomes, and the nuanced factors affecting the dynamics of cricket. Utilizing data analytics, we strive to provide detailed insights for improving player selection, formulating match strategies, and enhancing the overall cricket experience.

## Project Scope:

This project spans various critical stages, mirroring the workflow of a data analyst in a corporate environment, including:

Designing and implementing a relational database schema for efficient data storage and management. Employing SQL (MySQL or SQL Server) for data manipulation and querying. Executing comprehensive data analysis and preprocessing on the provided datasets. Creating an interactive dashboard in Power BI to display key metrics and insights.

### Project Phases

#### Phase 1: Database Design and Implementation 
##### Objective: 
Design a database schema that accurately represents the data's structure and relationships, and populate it with cleaned data. Craft a normalized relational database schema to encapsulate entities and their interrelations. Implement the schema in MySQL or SQL Server, establish tables, and define relationships. Efficiently import the cleaned data into the database.
